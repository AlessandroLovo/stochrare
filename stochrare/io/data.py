Data module
===========

.. currentmodule:: stochrare.io.data

This module (to be written) should be used to store on disk the results of computations made with
stochrare for future use, and to load such files in a script or an interactive session.

The goal is not only to store the data, but also to include metadata to make it clear how the data
was generated originally.
