# stochtrans

This repository contains pedagogical Python code with the purpose of illustrating some aspects of metastability or loss of stability problems. 
In particular, we focus on the role of noise on such transitions.
For simplicity, the code here only considers very simple 1D models, such as a double well potential or a saddle-node bifurcation.

I shall add later Python notebooks making use of this code, and references to the relevant litterature.
